# Statistical Analysis and Visualization of Iranian Academic Research Projects

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize statistical data related to **academic research projects in Iran**. Using Python, the project generates various charts and figures to explore research characteristics such as project type, funding source, academic field, institution, and temporal trends.

The primary goal is to provide **clear, reproducible, and interpretable visual insights** that support academic analysis and research policy evaluation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze key characteristics of Iranian academic research projects  
- Generate statistical charts for exploratory data analysis  
- Provide reproducible Python-based visualizations  
- Support academic and policy-oriented research studies  

---

## 📊 Features
The project currently supports generating:
- Bar charts (e.g., number of projects by field or institution)
- Line charts (e.g., yearly trends of research projects)
- Pie charts (e.g., distribution by funding source)
- Histograms (e.g., project duration or budget distribution)

All charts are generated using open-source Python libraries.
